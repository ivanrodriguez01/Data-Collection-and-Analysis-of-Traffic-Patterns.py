# MVC_First_ofPthe_Year_Block_Group

This project is based on the Massachusetts Vehicle Census (MVC) that joins Vehicle-Level odometer, readings  with attribute and registration transaction histories. This powerful resource allows policymarkers, researchers, and other stakeholders understand state and local trends in vehicle usage and ownership.

The Massachusetts Vehicle Census First of the Year Block Group dataset contains historical point in time snapshots of the amount of vehicles and estimated daily VMT (Vehicle Miles Travelled) grouped by BlockGroup, municipality and vehicle attribute. The dataset uses excise tax data and annual vehicle inspection odometer readings ad data inputs.
