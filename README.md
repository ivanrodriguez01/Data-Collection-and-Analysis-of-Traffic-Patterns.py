# Data-Collection-TP
Data Collection and Analysis of Traffic Patterns.

This is my first project where I'll have hands-on real practice for Data Science,
I want to combine my Transportation and Highway Degree with Data Science.

I'll start looking for traffic data in the US, I'm focused to get the data in the East Coast.
I'll be using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other libraries. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

I need to install the following libraries:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
```

You'll also need to install Jupyter Notebook, you can find the instructions here:

```
https://jupyter.org/install
```

### Installing

You can install the libraries with PIP, for example:

```
pip install pandas
```

You can also install the libraries with Anaconda, for example:

```
conda install pandas
```

## Running the tests

You can run the tests by running the Jupyter Notebook file, and running each cell.

But it doesn't really matter as long as I get data, I'll be happy.

I'll be using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other libraries to get the data,
